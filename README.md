# TideWatch
TideWatch is a modern web app for tracking real-time tide data, finding the best fishing times, and saving favorite coasts. It automatically detects your location, fetches nearby tide station data, and works offline with cached information â€” all in a clean, responsive interface built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
